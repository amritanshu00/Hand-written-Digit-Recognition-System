# Hand-written-Digit-Recognition-System
This deep learning solutions allows us to recognize a hand written digit. It takes in input a user written digit and classifies it as one of 0-9 digits. This project is an example of how multi class classification works. It is entirely written in python, it uses keras, pandas,numpy and scikit_learn. The data used is from MNIST dataset.
